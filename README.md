# Arduino-Bytebeat-Eurorack
this is based on stimmer's code from the arduino forums, based on Viznut's work
see viznut's blog http://countercomplex.blogspot.com/2011/10/algorithmic-symphonies-from-one-line-of.html
and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtQdIYUtAHg&feature=related

So all this does is take the original code, add an X and Y input with pots, and a "function" selector with a button

it hasn't been tested yet, but it compiles!
